   req_system

   req_config_manager
   req_netif_tunnel

Overview
--------

Requirements define **what** the system should do. They are:

* **Traceable** - Each requirement has a unique ID
* **Testable** - Can be verified through testing
* **Clear** - Unambiguous and specific
* **Linked** - Connected to design and implementation

Requirement Hierarchy
---------------------

Requirements are organized in two levels:

1. **System Requirements** (``REQ_SYS_*``) - High-level system capabilities
2. **Component Requirements** - Detailed component-level specifications

   * ``REQ_WEB_*`` - Web server and user interface
   * ``REQ_CFG_*`` - Configuration management
   * ``REQ_NETIF_TUNNEL_*`` - QEMU network tunnel driver

Component requirements are **linked** to their parent system requirements using Sphinx-Needs ``:links:`` attribute.

All requirements use Sphinx-Needs directives for automatic traceability and validation.
