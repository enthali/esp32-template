## System Requirements

### REQ-SYS-1: ESP32 Hardware Platform

### REQ-SYS-2: Real-time Distance Measurement

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL continuously measure distance and update LED display in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Distance measurements updated at minimum 10Hz frequency
- AC-2: LED display reflects distance changes within 100ms
- AC-3: System maintains real-time performance under all operating conditions

### REQ-SYS-3: WiFi Connectivity

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide WiFi connectivity in both Access Point (AP) and Station (STA) modes.

**Rationale**: Enables web interface access and network configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: System creates WiFi Access Point for initial configuration
- AC-2: System connects to existing WiFi networks as station
- AC-3: Automatic fallback to AP mode if STA connection fails

### REQ-SYS-4: Web-based Configuration

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide web interface for configuration and monitoring.

**Rationale**: User-friendly interface for system setup and operation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Web interface accessible via HTTP
- AC-2: Configuration changes applied without firmware recompilation
- AC-3: Real-time monitoring of system status and sensor data

### REQ-SYS-5: Non-volatile Configuration Storage

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL persist configuration settings across power cycles.

**Rationale**: Maintains user settings and system configuration permanently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Configuration survives device reset and power loss
- AC-2: Factory reset capability restores default settings
- AC-3: Configuration corruption detection and recovery

### REQ-SYS-6: Component-based Architecture

**Type**: Design  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL implement modular component-based architecture.

**Rationale**: Enables maintainability, testability, and reusability.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Distance sensor implemented as independent component
- AC-2: LED controller implemented as independent component
- AC-3: Components provide well-defined APIs
- AC-4: Main application coordinates components without tight coupling

### REQ-SYS-7: Error Handling and Recovery

**Type**: Reliability  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL handle errors gracefully and attempt recovery.

**Rationale**: Ensures system reliability and user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Sensor timeouts handled without system crash
- AC-2: WiFi connection failures trigger automatic retry
- AC-3: System logs errors for diagnostics
- AC-4: Watchdog timer prevents system hang

### REQ-SYS-8: Memory Management

**Type**: Performance  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL manage memory efficiently within ESP32 constraints.

**Rationale**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures stable operation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Heap usage monitored and bounded

### REQ-SYS-SIM-1: Emulator / Simulator Build Support

**Type**: Design / Testability

**Priority**: Mandatory

**Description**: The system SHALL provide a build-time selectable emulator/simulator mode that replaces hardware-near modules with simulator implementations while preserving the public component APIs and runtime behavior seen by higher-level modules. Simulator implementations MUST be selectable without modifying header files or higher-level application code.

**Rationale**: Enables development and testing on host environments (QEMU) without physical hardware, improves reproducibility and CI test coverage, and enforces clean module boundaries that encapsulate hardware dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: A Kconfig option `CONFIG_TARGET_EMULATOR` (or equivalent) exists to enable emulator builds via `menuconfig` or `idf.py -DCONFIG_TARGET_EMULATOR=1 build`.
- AC-2: Simulator implementations are selected by the buildsystem (CMake) and compiled in place of hardware implementations (example: `distance_sensor_sim.c` vs `distance_sensor.c`) without requiring changes to header files or higher-layer code.
- AC-3: Simulator components MUST implement the complete public API of their hardware counterparts and return identical error codes and semantics for consumers (blocking queue semantics, return values, state queries).
- AC-4: The distance sensor simulator SHALL produce deterministic measurements performing a linear sweep from 5cm to 60cm and back with 1mm resolution, advancing once per second; measurements are published on the processed measurement queue using the same `distance_measurement_t` structure and status codes.
- AC-5: The LED controller simulator SHALL maintain the same in-RAM buffer semantics and `led_show()` API; physical transmission is replaced by a rate-limited terminal visualization (≈1Hz) using unobtrusive symbols (emoji or ASCII) to reflect per-pixel state.
- AC-6: The web server and WiFi manager MAY be left unchanged in emulator builds; lack of real WiFi events is acceptable and must not cause crashes. The emulator requirement does not mandate network stack simulation in the first iteration.
- AC-7: The emulator build SHALL be runnable under QEMU (or a documented emulator) and produce observable LED visualization and distance measurement output in the serial console.
- AC-8: Documentation in `docs/design/` and `docs/requirements/` updated to reference simulator design artifacts and provide build/run verification steps.

## Compliance and Validation

### Traceability

All requirements SHALL be traceable to:

- Design specifications in `docs/design/`
- Implementation in `main/` and `components/`
- Test cases in `docs/test/`

### Validation Method

- **Inspection**: Code review and documentation review
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, system tests  
- **Analysis**: Static analysis and memory profiling
- **Demonstration**: Live system demonstration

### Change Management

- Requirements changes tracked through Git version control
- Impact analysis performed for all requirement modifications
- Traceability updated when requirements change
- Approval required for mandatory requirement changes
