# Web Server Requirements

**Document ID**: REQ-WEB-ESP32-DISTANCE  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**Author**: ESP32 Distance Project Team  
**Parent Document**: SRS-ESP32-DISTANCE  

## Document Purpose

This document specifies essential web server requirements for user interface, configuration, and WiFi setup functionality. Focus on user-facing features rather than implementation details.

## Requirements Dependencies

- REQ-WEB-2 depends on REQ-CFG-* (configuration parameters defined in configuration manager)
- REQ-WEB-4 depends on REQ-WEB-1, REQ-WEB-2, REQ-WEB-3 (navigation requires multiple pages)

**Note**: Design documentation intentionally omitted for web server requirements as implementation primarily involves integrating existing ESP-IDF HTTP server components rather than novel development.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-WEB-1: Real-time Status Display

**Type**: User Interface  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide a web page that displays current distance measurements with real-time updates for user monitoring.

**Rationale**: Users need to monitor the device's operation and verify distance measurements remotely via web interface.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Main page SHALL display current distance measurement value
- AC-2: Distance values SHALL update in real-time with reasonable responsiveness
- AC-3: Page SHALL indicate measurement status (normal, error, out-of-range)
- AC-4: Page SHALL be accessible via web browser on mobile and desktop devices

**Verification**: Access main page, verify distance values update correctly and status indicators work as expected.

### REQ-WEB-2: Configuration Interface

**Type**: User Interface  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide a web page for configuring device parameters as defined in the configuration management requirements (REQ-CFG-*).

**Rationale**: Users need to adjust device settings remotely without firmware recompilation or physical access.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Configuration page SHALL allow modification of all parameters defined in REQ-CFG-1 through REQ-CFG-11
- AC-2: Parameter changes SHALL be validated before applying
- AC-3: Users SHALL be able to save configuration changes permanently
- AC-4: Users SHALL be able to reset configuration to factory defaults
- AC-5: Page SHALL provide feedback on successful or failed configuration updates

**Verification**: Access configuration page, modify parameters, verify changes are saved and applied correctly.

### REQ-WEB-3: WiFi Network Selection (Captive Portal)

**Type**: User Interface  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide a captive portal interface for WiFi network selection and credential entry when operating in Access Point mode.

**Rationale**: Users need a simple way to connect the device to their WiFi network without requiring technical knowledge or special software.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Captive portal SHALL automatically appear when users connect to device's AP
- AC-2: Portal SHALL scan and display available WiFi networks
- AC-3: Users SHALL be able to select network and enter credentials (SSID/password)
- AC-4: Portal SHALL provide feedback on connection success or failure
- AC-5: Device SHALL switch to Station mode after successful WiFi connection

**Verification**: Connect to device AP, verify captive portal appears, test network selection and credential entry.

### REQ-WEB-4: Navigation Interface

**Type**: User Interface  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide navigation between web pages to allow users to easily switch between status display, configuration, and WiFi setup interfaces.

**Rationale**: Users need intuitive navigation to access different device functions without remembering specific URLs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: All pages SHALL include navigation menu or links to other pages
- AC-2: Current page SHALL be clearly indicated in navigation
- AC-3: Navigation SHALL work consistently across mobile and desktop browsers
- AC-4: Users SHALL be able to access any page from any other page within 2 clicks

**Verification**: Navigate between all pages, verify menu consistency and user experience across different devices.

## Requirements Summary

**Total Requirements**: 4

- **User Interface**: 4 requirements (status display, configuration, WiFi setup, navigation)

**Priority Distribution**:

- **Mandatory**: 4 requirements

**Key Benefits**:

- **Remote Monitoring**: Users can check device status from anywhere on the network
- **Easy Configuration**: No firmware recompilation needed for parameter changes
- **Simple WiFi Setup**: Non-technical users can connect device to their network
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear navigation between device functions

**Implementation Notes**:

- Configuration parameters referenced from REQ-CFG-* to avoid duplication
- Focus on user experience rather than technical implementation
- Assumes existing ESP-IDF HTTP server and WiFi components
- Design details left to implementation phase for flexibility
