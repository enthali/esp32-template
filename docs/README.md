# Welcome to the ESP32 Distance Sensor Project!

![Project Demo](assets/images/setup.jpg)

This project brings together the ESP32, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a WS2812 LED strip to create a fun, interactive distance display. Whether you're here to tinker, learn embedded development, or join our hands-on workshop—you're in the right place!

## 🚀 Get Started
- **Curious?** Jump right in, fire up your codespace and explore the code, hardware, and live demos.
- **New to ESP32?** Check out our [Getting Started Guide](workshop/gettingstartet.md) for step-by-step help.
- **Want to build it yourself?** See the [Hardware Setup](workshop/hardwaresetup.md) and [Workshop Prerequisites](workshop/prerequisites.md).
- **Ready for a challenge?** Try the [Workshop Exercises](workshop/README.md) and level up your skills!

## 💡 Why this project?
- Learn modern embedded development with real hardware
- Use GitHub Codespaces and Copilot for a seamless dev experience
- See your code come to life—literally lighting up!
