Overview
--------

Requirements define **what** the system should do. They are:

* **Traceable** - Each requirement has a unique ID
* **Testable** - Can be verified through testing
* **Clear** - Unambiguous and specific
* **Linked** - Connected to design and implementation

Requirement Categories
----------------------

Requirements are categorized using the following prefixes:

* ``REQ-SYS-*`` - System-level requirements
* ``REQ-CFG-*`` - Configuration management requirements
* ``REQ-WEB-*`` - Web interface requirements
* ``REQ-NET-*`` - Network and connectivity requirements

All requirements use Sphinx-Needs directives for automatic traceability and validation.
