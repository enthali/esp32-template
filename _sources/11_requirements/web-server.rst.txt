Web Server Requirements
=======================

This document specifies component-level requirements for the web server functionality, enabling user interface, configuration, and WiFi setup capabilities.

Component Overview
------------------

The web server component provides HTTP-based user interface and configuration capabilities. These requirements refine the high-level system requirement :need:`REQ_SYS_WEB_1`.


Functional Requirements
-----------------------

.. req:: Real-time Status Display
   :id: REQ_WEB_1
   :links: REQ_SYS_WEB_1
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: web, ui, monitoring

   **Description:** The system SHALL provide a web page that displays current system status with real-time updates for user monitoring.

   **Rationale:** Users need to monitor the device's operation remotely via web interface without requiring physical access.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: Main page SHALL display current system status
   - AC-2: Status values SHALL update with reasonable responsiveness
   - AC-3: Page SHALL indicate system state (normal, error, warning)
   - AC-4: Page SHALL be accessible via web browser on mobile and desktop devices


.. req:: Configuration Interface
   :id: REQ_WEB_2
   :links: REQ_SYS_WEB_1, REQ_CFG_3
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: web, ui, configuration

   **Description:** The system SHALL provide a web page for configuring device parameters as defined in the configuration management requirements.

   **Rationale:** Users need to adjust device settings remotely without firmware recompilation or physical access.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: Settings page SHALL display all user-configurable parameters
   - AC-2: Settings page SHALL validate user input ranges before submission
   - AC-3: Settings page SHALL provide immediate feedback on invalid inputs
   - AC-4: Settings page SHALL confirm successful parameter updates
   - AC-5: Settings page SHALL handle configuration save errors gracefully


.. req:: WiFi Setup Interface
   :id: REQ_WEB_3
   :links: REQ_SYS_NET_1
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: web, wifi, network

   **Description:** The system SHALL provide a captive portal WiFi setup page for initial network configuration.

   **Rationale:** Users need an intuitive method to configure WiFi credentials without serial console access or hardcoded credentials.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: Device SHALL start in AP mode when WiFi credentials are not configured
   - AC-2: WiFi setup page SHALL display available WiFi networks (SSID scan)
   - AC-3: WiFi setup page SHALL accept SSID and password input
   - AC-4: WiFi setup page SHALL validate credentials by attempting connection
   - AC-5: WiFi setup page SHALL provide feedback on connection success/failure
   - AC-6: Device SHALL switch to STA mode after successful WiFi configuration


.. req:: Web Interface Navigation
   :id: REQ_WEB_4
   :links: REQ_SYS_WEB_1
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: web, ui, navigation

   **Description:** The system SHALL provide navigation between multiple web pages (status, settings, WiFi setup).

   **Rationale:** Users need to access different functionality areas without memorizing URLs.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: All pages SHALL include navigation menu or links
   - AC-2: Navigation SHALL clearly indicate current page
   - AC-3: Navigation SHALL be accessible on mobile devices
   - AC-4: Page URLs SHALL be intuitive and RESTful (e.g., `/`, `/settings`, `/wifi`)


.. req:: HTTP Server Concurrency
   :id: REQ_WEB_5
   :links: REQ_SYS_WEB_1
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: web, performance

   **Description:** The web server SHALL handle multiple simultaneous HTTP connections without blocking.

   **Rationale:** Multiple users or browser tabs may access the device simultaneously.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: Web server SHALL support at least 4 concurrent connections
   - AC-2: Server SHALL respond to new connections within 2 seconds under load
   - AC-3: Server SHALL not crash or hang under concurrent access
   - AC-4: Connection handling SHALL not interfere with real-time system operation


Non-Functional Requirements
----------------------------

.. req:: Web UI Responsiveness
   :id: REQ_WEB_NF_1
   :links: REQ_WEB_1, REQ_WEB_2
   :status: approved
   :priority: optional
   :tags: web, performance, ux

   **Description:** Web pages SHOULD load and render within 3 seconds on typical mobile/desktop browsers.

   **Rationale:** Responsive UI improves user experience and reduces perceived latency.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: Initial page load SHALL complete within 3 seconds (excluding network latency)
   - AC-2: Navigation between pages SHALL feel instantaneous (<500ms)
   - AC-3: AJAX updates SHALL not cause page flickering or layout shifts


.. req:: Mobile-First Design
   :id: REQ_WEB_NF_2
   :links: REQ_WEB_1, REQ_WEB_2, REQ_WEB_3
   :status: approved
   :priority: optional
   :tags: web, ui, mobile

   **Description:** Web interface SHOULD be optimized for mobile devices with responsive design.

   **Rationale:** Many users will access the device from smartphones in the field.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   - AC-1: UI SHALL be usable on screens as small as 320px width
   - AC-2: Touch targets SHALL be at least 44x44px for mobile usability
   - AC-3: Text SHALL be readable without zooming on mobile devices


Traceability
------------

**Parent Requirements:**

- :need:`REQ_SYS_WEB_1` - Web-based configuration interface (high-level)
- :need:`REQ_SYS_NET_1` - WiFi connectivity (high-level)

**Related Requirements:**

- Configuration Manager requirements (REQ-CFG-*) define configurable parameters
- Network requirements define WiFi connectivity behavior
