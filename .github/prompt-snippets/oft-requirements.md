# OpenFastTrack Requirements Engineering Guidelines

## Requirements Methodology

This project follows **OpenFastTrack (OFT)** methodology for requirements engineering, ensuring traceability from requirements through implementation to testing.

## Requirements Structure

### Standard Format

```markdown
### REQ-<AREA>-<NUMBER>: <Title>

**Type**: <Implementation|Design|Performance|Reliability|Security>  
**Priority**: <Mandatory|High|Medium|Low>  
**Description**: <Detailed requirement using SHALL/SHOULD/MAY language>

**Rationale**: <Why this requirement exists and its business/technical justification>

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: <Specific, testable criterion>
- AC-2: <Another specific criterion>
- AC-N: <Additional criteria as needed>
```

### Area Codes

- **CFG**: Configuration Management
- **WEB**: Web Interface and HTTP Server
- **SEC**: Security and HTTPS
- **HW**: Hardware Interface (sensors, LEDs)
- **SYS**: System-level requirements
- **NET**: Networking and WiFi
- **API**: API and data interfaces

## Writing Standards

### Language Requirements

- **SHALL**: Mandatory requirement (must be implemented)
- **SHOULD**: Recommended requirement (implement unless good reason not to)
- **MAY**: Optional requirement (implementation discretionary)

### Acceptance Criteria Guidelines

- Each AC must be **specific and testable**
- Use measurable terms where possible (timeouts, ranges, counts)
- Focus on **behavior**, not implementation details
- Keep within the scope of the single requirement

### Traceability Requirements

- Each requirement must have unique ID
- Reference other requirements explicitly: "defined in REQ-CFG-1"
- Implementation code must include requirement ID in comments
- Test cases must reference requirement IDs

## ESP32 Project Specific Guidelines

### Configuration Requirements (REQ-CFG-*)

- Focus on centralized parameter management
- Include specific parameter names and ranges
- Address both compile-time and runtime configuration
- Consider ESP32 memory constraints

### Hardware Requirements (REQ-HW-*)

- Specify GPIO pin assignments
- Include timing constraints (HC-SR04, WS2812)
- Address power management considerations
- Document hardware abstraction boundaries

### Web Interface Requirements (REQ-WEB-*)

- Consider mobile responsiveness
- Address both HTTP and HTTPS variants
- Include captive portal functionality
- Specify API endpoints and data formats

### Security Requirements (REQ-SEC-*)

- Address certificate management
- Consider ESP32 memory constraints for SSL
- Include both local device and network security
- Address credential storage in NVS

## Implementation Traceability

### Code Comments

```c
/**
 * @brief Initialize centralized configuration system
 * 
 * Implements REQ-CFG-1: Centralized Configuration Header
 * Implements REQ-CFG-5: Configuration API
 * 
 * @return ESP_OK on success, error code on failure
 */
esp_err_t config_init(void);
```

### Test References

```c
// Test case for REQ-CFG-6: Parameter Validation
TEST_CASE("Configuration parameter range validation", "[config][REQ-CFG-6]")
{
    // Test implementation validating AC-1, AC-2, AC-3
}
```

## Document Organization

### Requirements Documents Location

- `docs/requirements/` - All requirements documents
- Use descriptive filenames: `config-requirements.md`, `web-interface-requirements.md`
- Include traceability tables linking requirements to design and tests

### Version Control

- Requirements changes require version bumps
- Use git branches for requirements development
- Link requirements changes to implementation PRs

## Review Process

### Requirements Review Checklist

- [ ] Unique requirement ID assigned
- [ ] Clear, testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Appropriate priority level
- [ ] Rationale explains why requirement exists
- [ ] Traceability links maintained
- [ ] Language follows SHALL/SHOULD/MAY conventions
- [ ] Scope is focused and single-responsibility

### Implementation Review

- [ ] Code references specific requirement IDs
- [ ] Implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test cases validate requirement compliance
- [ ] Design documents trace to requirements

## Current Project Status

**Active Requirements Area**: Configuration Management (REQ-CFG-*)
**Next Planned**: Web Interface Requirements (REQ-WEB-*)
**Parked for Future**: HTTPS Security Requirements (REQ-SEC-*)
