# Design Documentation

This directory contains system and component design documentation following the OpenFastTrack requirements engineering methodology.

## Overview

Design documents describe **how** requirements are implemented. They provide:

- System architecture and component structure
- Interface specifications and data flows
- Algorithm descriptions and implementation details
- Traceability links back to requirements

## Template Structure

When creating your own project, replace the example design documents with your own:

### System Design

- **[system-design.md](system-design.md)** - Overall system architecture template
  - Component diagram
  - System state machine
  - Data flow description
  - Technology stack

### Component Design Examples

- **[config-design.md](config-design.md)** - Configuration management example
  - NVS storage structure
  - API specification
  - Default values and validation

These serve as examples of how to structure your design documentation.

## Design Document Template

Each design document should include:

```markdown
# [Component Name] Design

## Overview

Brief description of the component and its role in the system.

## Requirements Coverage

Links to requirements this design satisfies:
- REQ-XXX-1: Requirement description
- REQ-XXX-2: Another requirement

## Architecture

### Component Diagram

```mermaid
[Diagram showing component structure]
```

### Interfaces

Public APIs and data structures.

### Data Structures

Key data types and their purpose.

## Implementation Details

### Algorithms

Key algorithms and their complexity.

### State Management

Component state machine if applicable.

### Error Handling

How errors are detected and reported.

## Dependencies

- External libraries
- Other components
- Hardware interfaces

## Testing Strategy

How the design can be tested and validated.
```

## OpenFastTrack Integration

Design documents use requirement IDs for traceability:

- `[REQ-XXX-N]` - Links to requirements
- Design IDs: `DSN-XXX-N` format
- Implementation references these IDs in code comments

See [OpenFastTrack documentation](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace) for more details.

## Tools

While OpenFastTrack can generate traceability reports, this template currently uses manual linking. Future enhancements may include automated traceability verification.

## Getting Started

1. Review example design documents
2. Copy template structure for your components
3. Link requirements using their IDs
4. Keep design synchronized with implementation
5. Update as requirements evolve

**This is a template directory.** Replace example designs with your project's actual design documentation.
