# Requirements Documentation

This directory contains system and component requirements documentation following the OpenFastTrack requirements engineering methodology.

## Overview

Requirements define **what** the system should do. They are:

- **Traceable** - Each requirement has a unique ID
- **Testable** - Can be verified through testing
- **Clear** - Unambiguous and specific
- **Linked** - Connected to design and implementation

## Template Structure

When creating your own project, replace the example requirements with your own:

### System Requirements

- **[system-requirements.md](system-requirements.md)** - High-level system requirements template
  - Functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability)
  - System constraints

### Component Requirements Examples

- **[config-requirements.md](config-requirements.md)** - Configuration management example
- **[web-server-requirements.md](web-server-requirements.md)** - Web server example

These serve as examples of how to structure your requirements documentation.

## Requirement Format

Each requirement follows this structure:

```markdown
### REQ-AREA-N: Requirement Title

**Type**: functional | non-functional  
**Priority**: high | medium | low  
**Status**: draft | approved | implemented | verified

**Description:**  
Clear statement of what is required.

**Rationale:**  
Why this requirement exists.

**Dependencies:**  
- REQ-XXX-M: Related requirement

**Verification:**  
How this requirement will be tested.
```

## Requirement IDs

Use consistent ID format: `REQ-<AREA>-<NUMBER>`

**Area examples:**

- `SYS` - System-level requirements
- `CFG` - Configuration management
- `WEB` - Web server
- `NET` - Networking
- `SEC` - Security
- `HW` - Hardware interface

## OpenFastTrack Integration

This template follows OpenFastTrack methodology:

- Requirements have unique IDs
- Design documents reference requirement IDs
- Code comments link to requirement IDs
- Tests verify specific requirements

See [OpenFastTrack documentation](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace) for more details.

## Traceability

Requirements flow through the development process:

```text
Requirements (REQ-*) 
    ↓
Design (DSN-*)
    ↓
Implementation (code comments)
    ↓
Tests (TEST-*)
```

Each layer references the layer above it for full traceability.

## Getting Started

1. Review example requirements documents
2. Define your system requirements first
3. Break down into component requirements
4. Assign unique IDs consistently
5. Link to design documents as you create them
6. Reference requirements in code comments
7. Create tests that verify requirements

## Best Practices

- **Start broad, then narrow** - System requirements first, then components
- **Keep requirements atomic** - One testable requirement per ID
- **Use clear language** - Avoid ambiguity (shall, must, should)
- **Review regularly** - Requirements evolve with understanding
- **Maintain traceability** - Always link to design and code
